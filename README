Daily Learning Planner
Overview
The Daily Learning Planner is a single-page web application designed to organize, track, and visualize daily tasks. It features a responsive interface with a monthly activity heatmap, customizable templates, and interactive progress tracking. All data is stored privately in the browser's local storage.

Key Features
Progress Visualization:

Monthly Heatmap: Get an at-a-glance view of your monthly activity, with days color-coded by task completion percentage.

Circular Progress Bars: Each day's summary includes a circular progress bar showing the overall completion rate.

Customizable Planning:

Dynamic Templates: Add or remove categories (e.g., "DSA," "Gym") on any day. Changes update the default template for plans without altering past entries.

Smart Defaults: New daily plans are automatically created using the template from your most recently planned day.

Interactive UI:

Collapsible Summaries: Daily plans are displayed as collapsible dropdowns to keep the dashboard clean. Current and future days are expanded by default.

Weekly Pagination: Navigate through your plans week by week (Sunday to Saturday).

Dark & Light Modes: Toggle between themes with a convenient header button. Your preference is saved automatically.

Getting Started
Plan a Day: Select a date and click "Plan" to open the daily editor.

Manage Tasks: Add, edit, or delete tasks and categories directly within the daily editor.

Track Progress: Check off tasks on the main dashboard or in the daily editor to update your progress bars and heatmap in real-time.

Review History: Use the heatmap's month/year selectors and the weekly pagination to review past performance.
